Solution (Script and Sceenshots) is in folder VBA_HomeWork -----

I realzied at the end that I was supposed to name my repo 'VBA-challenge' amd was going to create a new repo and place my docs in it but then I would have lost my commit history (not sure what was worse--wrong repo name or losing commit history)...so i kept the wrong name.
