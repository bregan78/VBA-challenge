Solution (Script and Screenshots) is in folder ‘VBA_HomeWork’ -----

I realized at the end that I was supposed to name my repo 'VBA-challenge'. I was going to create a new repo and place my docs in it but then I would have lost my commit history (not sure what was worse--wrong repo name or losing commit history)...so I kept the wrong name.
